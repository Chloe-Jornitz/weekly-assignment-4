            <h6 class="body">I believe that a career related to computer science would suit me because I enjoy programming and would like to continue to learn more about programming and improve my knowledge with different programming languages. I like solving problems and the challenges that programming provides. I also like that in programming that there are multiple different ways to complete a task. A career in software engineering specifically interests me because I have considered having a career in engineering, as my favourite subjects in school are math and science and I typically do well in these areas. In my career, I want to be able to work with other software engineers and also learn more about the process of planning, designing and testing software to solve problems.</h6>

              <h4 class="h4">How does this career help fulfill the vocation of humanity?</h4>
              <h6 class="body">Software engineers create software and applications that can be used for many purposes. For example, the use of software in the medical field is increasing and software engineers can help create medical software. Medical software helps increase the accuracy of medical diagnoses, improve treatment of diseases or injuries and can save lives. Computer software also makes websites possible for many helpful companies and organizations. For example, people are now able to donate to charities online. This can increase the amount of money donated to people in need. People will be more likely to donate because it is more convenient, as they do not have to go out of their way to donate the money in person, but they can donate easily and quickly from home. Websites and online advertising can also spread awareness for world issues and make people realize the work that needs to be done to make the world a better place. God calls us to live our lives to our full potential and to help the less fortunate. Software engineers make this possible by advancing medical technology to allow people more time to accomplish God’s purpose for them and giving people opportunities to share their wealth and knowledge with others. This calling to reach my full potential and help others does help me to set priorities in school, work and my personal life. I know that I need to set my school work as a high priority so that I can get the grades necessary to get into the university program that I want, to both get a job that will bring me success and happiness and to gain new knowledge and understanding about the world. I know that I need to work hard and responsibly in my career so that I can do my job properly and be a good, trustworthy co-worker and employee. Finally, I know that I need to put the needs of others before myself when someone is struggling or needs support.</h6>
